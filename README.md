# Kingdom
Work In Progress

Pygame and numpy need to be installed to run

The IP address in the server file and the network file both 
need to be changed to the LAN that the server is to be hosted on.

Run server once and client twice

WASD to move the camera

Right click a building (trees, rocks, castle) to open the window,
buy a Lumbermill with intial gold to generate wood, buy a Mine with
wood to generate gold, buy troops from the castle with wood and gold,
left click off the window deselects the building.

Left click a troop to select it, right click to give it a target: be a
location, building or troop. The buildings and troops have hp that when 
equal to 0 will be removed, the buildings cannot be regenerated once dead.
The aim is to destroy the opponents castle.

This is not a completed project, but it is playable.

There may be problems with the graphics as they are not generalised to
different screen sizes but currently tailored to the screen I use.
